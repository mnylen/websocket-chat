h2. What?

A very simple web chat that uses WebSockets on the client side and Ruby EventMachine (with em-websocket) at the server side.

h2. Features

* Automatic scrolling of chat log
* Automatic refocus on message input after the previous message have been sent

h2. Usage

# clone the repo
# Install the *bundler* gem if you haven't already: <code>gem install bundler</code>
# Install dependencies using *bundler*: <code>bundle install</code>
# Start the server: <code>$ cd server; ruby server.rb</code>
# Fire up few browser instances and point them to <code>/[path you cloned it to]/client/chat.html</code>
# Write your nickname and click *Join chat*.
# After you've joined, feel free to send messages by pressing *Send*
# Any messages you send should appear on other browsers you have started

Runs the server on *localhost* on port *8080*. The client is hardcoded to connect to that server and port. If you want to modify these, you need to modify the source.

h2. Future improvements

* Allow specifying the host and the port the server should run on
* Allow specifying the host and the port the client should connect to
* Allow registering nicknames and displaying a list of already registered nicknames
* Show message after user enters or parts the chat
